                <p>I received a useful comment on <a href="https://blairconrad.com/2011/07/29/hasty-impressions-dotcover-1.1/">Friday's post about AutoTest.Net</a>. In the wee hours of Saturday, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/gregyoung/">Greg Young</a>, wrote to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should detect broken builds without any problem. We have been running it daily for about 1.5 months.<br>
Perhaps you could grab me via email and reproduce it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I wasn't going to pass up that offer. Off to GMail!</p>
<table>
<tr><td>7:15</td><td>I grabbed him</td></tr>
<tr><td>7:20</td><td>he was making specific requests for additional information, the output of test runs through the console runner, and the like. </td></tr>
<tr><td>8:00</td><td>he had dived into the code to verify that things were working as they should, and asked for a sample project that exhibited the bug.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8:20</td><td>I sent the code</td></tr>
<tr><td>8:31</td><td>I e-mailed that <i>I'd accidentally sent a project that complied</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>8:34</td><td>Greg reproduced the problem</td></tr>
<tr><td>8:54</td><td>he sent me a replacement .zip file</td></tr>
<tr><td>9:04</td><td>it worked!</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As soon as I broke the compilation, the monitor lit up, showing me which project failed and where:</p>
<pre>
[Info] 'AutoTest.Console.ConsoleApplication' Preparing build(s) and test run(s)
[Info] 'AutoTest.Console.ConsoleApplication' Error: D:\bconrad\Documents\Source\BlogExamples\2010-11-autotest\BookFinder\BookFinder.Core\BookListViewModel.cs(50,17) CS1002: ; expected [D:\bconrad\Documents\Source\BlogExamples\2010-11-autotest\BookFinder\BookFinder.Core\BookFinder.Core.csproj]
[Info] 'AutoTest.Console.ConsoleApplication' Ran 1 build(s) (0 succeeded, 1 failed) and 0 test(s) (0 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored)
</pre>

<p>It turns out that the bug had already been fixed on trunk version of the code, but for some reason hadn't been built into the Windows installer. Turnaround time: 1 hour 49 minutes from my initial e-mail, and that included:
<ul>
<li>me drifting off to other tasks between e-mails, increasing delays</li>
<li>a session of trying to work around GMail hating the zip file I tried to send</li>
<li>a delay imposed by my having sent a bad test project</li>
</ul>
I'm sure those things added a good half hour to the required time.</p>
<p>Then he spent another 40 minutes on a non-existent problem that I reported. I'd left an older AutoTest.Net WinForms monitor running during the debugging, so when things finally settled down, I got a pair of toasts from Growl - one reporting build failures, and one reporting successful builds when there weren't any.
When I discovered that, Greg was already installing a new Growl for Windows to try it out. And he was very gracious about my error and his wasted time.</p>
<p>I'm hardly the first to point it out, but this is one of the great things about open software. It's great getting that kind of service so quickly. And on a weekend no less.</p>
<h2>Will this encourage me to use AutoTest.Net</h2>

<p>Sure. My primary complaint with it has been resolved. 
Moreover, I'd be even more inclined to see what comes of Mighty Moose, now that I see the dedication of the developers behind it.</p>
