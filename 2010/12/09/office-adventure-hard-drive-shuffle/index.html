                <p>It's fashionable to complain about the IT department at the Day Job, but sometimes we get pretty good service. I had occasion to contact them today for two unrelated problems. The first, an issue with a Lotus Notes upgrade, was quickly resolved over the phone. The other problem involved hardware, and I'm well on the way to a resolution, with one minor snag.</p>
<p>While rebooting to pick up part of the Notes fix, I noticed something strange on my BIOS screen. I have two hard drives in my workstation, RAID-1ed together. The BIOS displayed one drive as green, and one red. Red is bad. I mentioned this to the Notes Fixer. Half an hour later I was contacted by a different IT guy. He wanted to come by and take the bad drive so he could order another one. "Sure!" said I.</p>
<p>IT Guy rebooted my machine again so he could see which drive was faulty. Then powered it down, popped open the case, extracted the hard drive and blew on it, releasing a cloud of toxic dust right above my tea. All this in less time than it takes to type it. He popped closed the case, and off  he went.</p>
<p>I started booting. I also powered up my computer. The computer beeped funny as it started up. I checked out the BIOS screen. One red drive.</p>
<p>No green drive.</p>
<p>"He took the wrong one!" I said, and hared off after him.</p>
<p>There I was, running through the halls, wearing one boot and one sock. <strong>Thump</strong>-thump. <strong>Thump</strong>-thump. <strong>Thump</strong>-thump. </p>
<p>"IT Guy," I called, as he hove into view. You see, I wanted to make sure I got him before he put the drive under the Big Magnet. Also, I didn't know where he sits.</p>
<p>I explained the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>B</b>: You took the wrong drive. I'd like that one back.<br>
<b>ITG</b>: Oh! Right. Thanks for coming after me.<br>
<b>B</b>: No problem. Of course, it wasn't for your benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We walked back to my cubicle, where he swapped drives and all was well. Then he left, with a cheerful, "We should have the new drive by tomorrow morning. Hey, where's your shoe?"</p>
