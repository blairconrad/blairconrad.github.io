It's a little late, but I'm participating in <a href="http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/new-years-python-meme/">Tarek Ziadé's Python Meme</a> (<a href="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard/log/Python/New_Year_s_Python_meme">via Richard Jones</a>):
<ol>
	<li><strong>What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2009?</strong>
              <p><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. I'd known of it before, but hadn't tried it until early this year when I started to <a href="/2010/01/08/meet-libraryhippo/">work on LibraryHippo</a>.</p></li>
	<li><strong>What new programming technique did you learn in 2009?</strong>
              <p>I'm not sure if this counts as a technique, but I recently found (and found a use for) Jean-Paul S. Boodhoo's <a href="http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/TheStaticGatewayPattern.aspx">Static Gateway Pattern</a>. At the Day Job, we have a lot of hard-coded dependencies and reliance on well-known static methods for authorization. The Static Gateway Pattern made it easy to provide an injectable implementation without rewriting the whole application. I expect it to continue to be useful, at least until we take the time to introduce a full  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">Inversion of Control</a> container.</p></li>
	<li><strong>What’s the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2009? What did you do?</strong>
              <p>I didn't, really. Unless you count LibraryHippo. I've an interest in working on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/">Noda Time</a>, but I haven't managed to yet.</p></li>
	<li><strong>What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2009?</strong>
              <p><a href="http://wordaligned.org/">Word Aligned</a></p></li>
	<li><strong>What are the three top things you want to learn in 2010?</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>more <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx">PowerShell</a></li>
                  <li>.NET Framework 4.0, and whatever I've missed since 1.1...</li>
                  <li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/">jQuery Ajax</a></li>
              </ul></li>
