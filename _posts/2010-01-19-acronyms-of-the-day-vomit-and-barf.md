<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/podcast.html">CBC's Ideas Podcast</a> today, specifically to <i>You Are "Pre-Diseased", Part 2</i> (which aired on 18 January and is available for download until mid-February, in case you want to listen) when I heard a new acronym that's relevant to my Day Job.</p>
<p><b>V</b>ictim <b>O</b>f <b>M</b>edical <b>I</b>maging <b>T</b>echnology refers to patients who are operated on after an abnormality is detected in an imaging procedure, but nothing is found during the operation.</p>
<p>Closely related is <b>B</b>rainlessly <b>A</b>pplying <b>R</b>adiological <b>F</b>indings - treating the result of an imaging study, not the patient and her symptoms.</p>

I don't mean to make light of the plight of patients who undergo operations or treatments when they're not warranted, but I thought the acronyms themselves are good for a chuckle. <a href="http://ctsurgcomplications.wikia.com/wiki/VOMIT:_victim_of_medical_%28or_modern%29_imaging_%28or_investigational%29_technology">Read more.</a>
