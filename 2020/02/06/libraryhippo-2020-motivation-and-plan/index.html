<p>For some years, I've run a hobby project, open to all, but mostly used by a few
of my friends and family, called <a href="http://libraryhippo.com/">LibraryHippo</a>. I
find it useful, and for a long time, it was a joy to work on.</p>
<p>Lately, the project's not much fun. I've had the urge to make small tweaks or
add the odd feature, but I haven't bothered. Whenever I'm tempted to, there've
been a few speedbumps:</p>
<ol>
<li>it's written in Python 2.7, which I'm trying to leave behind, and</li>
<li>it's running on Google App Engine</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm grateful to Google for providing a free tier of App Engine for projects such
as mine to run on, and I've benefitted a lot from it, but it's not without its
downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>many of the services have custom interfaces, that I only use there, so they
   fade from my memory, and</li>
<li>it seems every time I come back to the project, I have to update my SDK to
   even work with LibraryHippo, and sometimes learn new commands to deploy or
   monitor the service</li>
</ol>
<p>Since Python 2.7 is now unsupported, I'm looking to upgrade to 3.7. App Engine
documentation now suggests writing the application in
<a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a>, rather than the older framework.
The project seems well-regarded, so I read some documentation and looked at
Miguel Grinberg's amazing
<a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">The Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>,
(which I highly recommend: it's eminently readable, obviously well-researched,
and espouses good overall development practices), and decided to give that a
try.</p>
<p>I figured that since I'm doing a near-complete rewrite anyhow (some of the core
code should survive), it might be time to explore different hosting options,
making use of commodity databases, authentication, queuing, etc.</p>
<p>After a little searching, it looks as if <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> might be
the platform that meets my needs, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>web app hosting</li>
<li>a small (perhaps a few MB) persistent datastore</li>
<li>scheduled jobs</li>
<li>authentication via social accounts</li>
<li>sending e-mail</li>
<li>free, or nearly so; as I said, this is a hobby project, and I'm not willing
   to dump several tens of dollars into it every month</li>
</ol>
<p>I've other requirements, but these aren't likely to be deal-breakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>custom domain name</li>
<li>job queues</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the next few posts, I'm going to pick high-risk requirements from the above
list, and attempt to satisfy them via a Flask web application running on
Heroku's free tier. If I can satisfy (in the most rudimentary way) these
requirements, I'll pursue a full conversion.</p>
<p>I'll assign issues and pull requests that I make for this work to the
<a href="https://github.com/LibraryHippo/LibraryHippo/milestone/1">LibraryHippo 2020</a>
milestone.</p>
<p>Hopefully the series will serve as entertainment or education for you, and a
useful reference for me when I wonder how or why I did something.</p>
