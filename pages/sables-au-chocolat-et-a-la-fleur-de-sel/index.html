<ol>
  <li>Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter on medium speed until soft.</li>
  <li>Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and continue beating
    for another minute or two.</li>
  <li>Pour in the flour and mix just until combined - work the dough as
    little as possible once the flour is added, and don't be concerned if
    the dough looks a little crumbly.</li>
  <li>Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.</li>
  <li>Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and
    divide it in half.</li>
  <li>Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that
    are 4&nbsp;cm in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate
    them for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 170&deg;C/338&deg;F.</li>
  <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.</li>
  <li>Working with a sharp knife, slice the logs into rounds that are
    1&nbsp;cm thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you're cutting them -
    don't be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.)</li>
  <li>Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about 2&nbsp;cm between
    them.</li>
  <li>Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes - they
    won't look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they
    should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the
    cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can
    serve them or let them reach room temperature.</li>
</ol>

<p>Makes about 35 cookies</p>
