<li>Add raw cashews to a mixing bowl and cover with boiling hot water. Let rest uncovered for 1 hour. Then drain thoroughly.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F (176&deg;C) and line an 8&times;8&Prime; baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a high speed blender and mix on high until a fine meal is achieved.</li>
<li>Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and add maple syrup and melted coconut oil. Stir with a spoon to combine until a loose dough is formed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If it's too dry, add more oil.</li>
<li>Transfer mixture to the baking pan and spread evenly. Press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed.</li>
<li>Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C) and bake for 5&ndash;8 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly, then reduce oven heat to 350&deg;F (176&deg;C).</li>
<li>Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to a high speed blender with coconut cream, arrowroot starch, lemon juice, lemon zest, sea salt, and maple syrup. Mix on high until very creamy and smooth.</li>
<li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed. You may need more lemon zest and maple syrup. It should be very lemony, and not overly sweet.</li>
<li>Pour filling over the pre-baked crust and spread into an even layer. Tap on counter to remove any air bubbles.</li>
<li>Bake for 20&ndash;23 minutes or until the edges look very slightly dry and the center appears “jiggly” but not liquidy.</li>
<li>Let rest for 10 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator to let cool completely (uncovered) at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
