<li>Put the whole orange or oranges in a pan with some cold water, bring to a boil and cook for 2 hours or until soft.</li>
<li>Drain oranges, and when cool, cut the oranges in half and remove any big pips.</li>
<li>Puree everything&mdash;pith, peel and all&mdash;in a food processor.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
<li>Butter and line a 9&Prime; cake pan.</li>
<li>Add the eggs, baking powder, baking soda, almonds, sugar, and cocoa to the orange in the food processor. Run the motor until you have a cohesive cake mixture, but slightly knobbly with the flecks of pur√©ed orange.</li>
<li>Pour and scrape into the cake pan and bake for about 45 minutes, by which time a cake tester should come out pretty well clean.</li>
<li>Leave the cake to cool in the pan, on a cooling rack.</li>
<li>When the cake is cold you can take it out of the pan.</li>
<li>Decorate with strips of orange peel or coarsely grated zest if desired.</li>
