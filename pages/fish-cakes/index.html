  <h1>Fish Cakes</h1>

  <p>All recipes evolve, but this entry, more than most on the site, is a combination recipe and "what we did so we can try to get a better/more consistent procedure in the future". We were cobbling together instructions like "5&ndash;6 good sized potatoes" with other recipes we found online.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
  <li>About 1 day before cooking, start soaking the fish. Change the water every 12 hours or so, including before cooking.</li>
  <li>Boil the fish until flaky and tender. Maybe 40 minutes. Should taste somewhat salty at this point. Of course, if it doesn't, it's too late.</li>
  <li>Boil or steam potatoes, so suitable for mashing.</li>
  <li>Fry the onions in butter (or better yet, first fry diced salt pork fat, then add onions).</li>
  <li>Remove any bones and skin from the cod.</li>
  <li>Mash potatoes.</li>
  <li>Flake cod up good.</li>
  <li>Combine fish, potatoes, onions, summer savoury, and eggs (for binding). We had to use the turkey roaster.</li>
  <li>Shape into 136 g patties or "cakes".</li>
  <li>Fry 5+ minutes/side in butter.</li>
  <li>Eat with Habitant or other green chow chow.</li>
  <li>Freeze remainder in a single layer on cookie sheet maybe 2&frac12; hours before vacuum sealing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yield: about 26 fish cakes.</p>
