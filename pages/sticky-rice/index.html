<ol>
<li>
<p>Soak the sweet rice in water, same with the jasmine rice.  Soak the
   mushrooms, shrimp in water as well.  For at least 2&ndash;3 hours (I do
   it overnight sometimes or during the work day).  Soak each the
   mushrooms and shrimp separately from the rice and each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drain the water from each of the ingredients, but from the mushroom
   and shrimp reserve &frac14; cup of liquid to be used later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a food processor (or a knife and elbow grease), chop the
   mushrooms, shrimp and sausage (separately) into small pieces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a frying pan, stir fry the sausage until all the fat
   comes out.  Add the cooking wine and stir fry a bit.  Then
   add the drained mushrooms and shrimp. sugar and soya sauce.  Stir
   fry for about 5&ndash;10 minutes until it's all cooked.  Add more soy
   sauce or sugar to taste. Set aside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a large (preferably non stick) pot, add the chicken broth and
   &frac14; cup of the reserved soaking liquid from the mushroom and
   shrimp to make 1&frac34; cups of liquid total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it starts to boil, add the drained sweet and jasmine
   rice. Make sure the rice is immersed in the broth and wait to boil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once it starts to begin to boil add the sausage, shrimp, mushroom stir fry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave to cook but mix periodically to make sure it doesn't stick to
   the bottom of the pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a while the broth will be absorbed and the rice will be
   cooked (around 10 minutes?).  Then it is finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the rice has cooled a bit, mix in the chopped cilantro and green onions.</p>
</li>
