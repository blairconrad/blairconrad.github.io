                <p>This is the gala awards show, where my chosen coverage tool is announced. </p>
<p>If you've come this far, you've probably already read the title, and it won't surprise you to learn that I've chosen <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover">OpenCover</a>. It offered the best fit for my requirements - the only areas where I found it lacking were in the "nice to haves". Witness:
<ul>
   <li>OpenCover is pretty easy to <strong>run from the command line</strong> - second only to NCover.</li>
   <li>It can (with the help of ReportGenerator) generate <strong>coverage reports in XML and HTML</strong>.</li>
   <li>OpenCover has an integrated <strong>auto-deploy</strong>, so it can be bundled with the source tree and new developers or build servers just work - dotCover has no such option, and I was not able to use NCover this way.</li>
   <li>I've been able to <strong>link with TypeMock Isolator</strong> with little trouble, and the new Isolator may obviate the need for my small workaround.</li>
   <li><strong>It's free</strong>. Aside from the obvious benefit, it's nice to not have to count licenses when adding developers and/or build server nodes.</li>
   <li>There's <b>no GUI integration</b>, but this was a nice to have. If some developer is absolutely dying to have this, my boss's boss has indicated that money could be available for individual licenses of something like dotCover.</li>
   <li>There's <b>no support for integrating with IIS</b>. We don't need this right now, so that's okay. Again, if we one or two developers find a need, we have the option of buying a license of some other tool. Even better, support <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover/issues/36">may be coming soon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
After considering OpenCover's strengths in the areas I absolutely
needed, and its weaknesses, which all appear to be in areas that I
care a little less about, I recommended it the boss's boss, who agreed
with the assessment and was happy to keep a little money in his pocket
for now.</p>
<p>So, I grabbed 2.0.802, incorporated it into one product's build, and out popped coverage numbers. Very exciting. I did notice a few things, though:
<ol>
<li>Branch coverage has been added since I last evaluated the product!</li>
<li>One fairly complicated integration-style testfixture is not runnable under OpenCover - the class tested creates a background thread and starting the thread results in a <code>System.AccessViolationException</code>. I was unable to determine the cause of this, and have temporarily removed the test from coverage, instead executing it with NUnit directly. I'm going to continue investigating this problem.</li>
<li>Since I'm XCopy deploying, I was bitten by <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover/issues/52">the dependency on the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package</a> - I ended up including the DLLs in my imported bundle, and all was well, but I worry a little about the stability of this solution.</li>
<li>The time taken to execute our tests (there are over 5000, and many hit a database) increased from about 7 minutes to about 8. This is an acceptable degradation, since the test run isn't the bottleneck in our build process.</li>
<li>The number of "Cannot instrument  as no PDB could be loaded" messages is daunting. I'm hoping that things will be improved once I get a build that contains a fix for <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover/issues/40">issue 40</a>.</li>
</ol></p>
