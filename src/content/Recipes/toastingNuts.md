title: Toasting Nuts
---
<p>To toast nuts, spread raw nuts on a baking sheet and toast in a
  preheated 350&deg;F (175&deg;C) oven for about 10 minutes, stirring
  once or twice to make sure they are browning evenly. To test doneness,
  snap open a nut: it should break cleanly and the inside should be
  lightly browned throughout.</p>
