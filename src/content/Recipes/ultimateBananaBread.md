1. Cover and microwave first 5 bananas about 5 minutes, until they are soft and have released their liquid.
1. Drain bananas in fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, stirring occasionally. After 15 minutes you should have between &frac12; and &frac34; c liquid.
1. Whisk together flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
1. Reduce collected banana juice over medium-high heat until you have about &frac14; c.
1. Mash reduced juice back into bananas.
1. Whisk butter, eggs, sugar, and vanilla into bananas.
1. Barely stir flour mixture into banana mixture.
1. Fold in walnuts, if using.
1. Put the batter in a greased (or parchment papered) 8&frac12;&Prime;&times;4&frac12;&Prime; loaf pan.
1. If desired, shingle batter by layering 2 rows of banana slices down the pan, leaving a 1&frac12;&Prime; gap in the middle. Keep banana slices away from edges of the pan, or they stick.
1. Sprinkle sugar on top of batter.
1. Bake at 350&deg;F for 55&ndash;75 minutes, rotating pan halfway through the baking. Remove from oven when a toothpick inserted in the loaf comes out clean.
1. Let loaf cool in pan for 10 minutes.
1. Let load cool on rack for 1 hour before serving. Or cool completely and store at room temperature up to 3 days.

<div class="variation">
<h2>Variation: from frozen bananas (at least the first 5)</h2>
<p>Instead of microwaving and draining fresh bananas, defrost frozen bananas in a fine mesh sieve over a bowl, collecting the liquid.</p>
