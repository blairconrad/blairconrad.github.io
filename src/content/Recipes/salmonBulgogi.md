1. Blend all ingredients except salmon in mini processor.
2. Arrange salmon in a glass baking dish. Spoon marinade over (excess marinade may be heated and used as additional glaze when serving). Let marinate 30 minutes, if time allows, but at least 5 minutes. 
3. Preheat oven to 500&deg;F.
4. Roast fish until it reaches 140&deg;F in the center, when checked with an instant-read thermometer.
