1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
2. In a 9&times;9&Prime; baking dish, mix together the sliced peaches, honey,
   arrowroot starch, vanilla, and cinnamon.
3. Stir the oats, almond meal, sliced almonds, coconut sugar, ginger, salt, and
   butter until moistened throughout.
4. Dollop spoonfuls of the oat mixture over the filling and use your fingers to
   break up the mixture until it is evenly distributed (no need to pack it
   down).
5. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling around the edges
   and the top is lightly golden.
