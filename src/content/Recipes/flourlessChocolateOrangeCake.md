1. Put the whole orange or oranges in a pan with some cold water, bring to a boil and cook for 2 hours or until soft.
2. Drain oranges, and when cool, cut the oranges in half and remove any big pips.
3. Puree everything&mdash;pith, peel and all&mdash;in a food processor.
4. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
5. Butter and line a 9&Prime; cake pan.
6. Add the eggs, baking powder, baking soda, almonds, sugar, and cocoa to the orange in the food processor. Run the motor until you have a cohesive cake mixture, but slightly knobbly with the flecks of pur√©ed orange.
7. Pour and scrape into the cake pan and bake for about 45 minutes, by which time a cake tester should come out pretty well clean.
8. Leave the cake to cool in the pan, on a cooling rack.
9. When the cake is cold you can take it out of the pan.
10. Decorate with strips of orange peel or coarsely grated zest if desired.
