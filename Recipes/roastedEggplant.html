<li>Cut the eggplant into 1&Prime; cubes and place in a bowl.</li>
<li>Sprinkle salt, garlic and oil over eggplant.</li>
<li>Toss well and alllow to site for 30 minutes for flavours to blend.</li>
<li>Spread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. They'll roast better with a little space between them.</li>
<li>Roast at 375&deg; for about 45 minutes, tossing a few times during roasting. Roast until the cubes are brown and the insides creamy.</li>
<li>Serve hot or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Variation: freezing</h2>
<p>In theory, after roasting you could put the cooled cubes on a baking sheet in the freezer, and once hard, scrape them into a bag for freezing.
  We've just put them in a bag without separately freezing. Let's see what happens.</p>
