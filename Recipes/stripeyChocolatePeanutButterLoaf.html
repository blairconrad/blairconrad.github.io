<h1>Stripey Chocolate Peanut Butter Loaf</h1>

<p><em>I like to make lots of stuff at once and freeze it. Also, I
don't care for dividing batter. So this will make two loaves. That's
why most of the ingredients are listed twice. Pay attention. You'll
need 4 eggs for this, not 2, and 3 cups of milk, not
1&frac12;.</em></p>

<p>We're going to make two loaves here. I find the easiest thing is to just make two batches of batter. So do all this twice. If you have a huge mixer, you can just put twice the ingredients in the bowl and then divide the batter later. Whatever works for you.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Beat butter and sugar until fluffly.</li>
  <li>Beat eggs and vanilla into the butter.</li>
  <li>Beat the peanut butter in to the butter mixture.</li>
  <li>Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture.</li>
  <li>Stir in the milk until smooth.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have two bowls of peanut butter batter, you can make one chocolatey and then stripe them up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Whisk the cocoa powder with the water until it's combined, mostly to make it easier to mix into the batter.</li>
  <li>Fold the cocoa sludge into one of the bowls of peanut butter batter.</li>
  <li>Take two greased pans. In each one:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Spoon a generous &frac14; c of chocolate batter into the bottom.</li>
    <li>Jiggle the pan or gently spread the batter with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Spoon a generous &frac14; c of peanut butter batter on top of that.</li>
    <li>Jiggle the pan or gently spread the batter with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Keep going until you're out of batter.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Bake at 350&deg;F for 60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer from pans to rack.</li>
  <li>(If glazing, apply glaze now. Although if you're glazing, you probably wanted a sweeter bread and should've used more sugar.</li>
  <li>Allow to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

from <a href="http://www.canadianliving.com/food/stripey_chocolate_peanut_butter_loaf.php">Canadian
Living's Stripey Chocolate Peanut Butter Loaf</a>. The original recipe was for one loaf and had the same (total) amount of sugar. Also a sugary topping. (It's just 1 T water plus &frac12; c icing sugar brushed on the top of each of the warm loaves.)</p>
