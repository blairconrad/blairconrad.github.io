<ol>
<li>Preheat an oven to 350&deg;F
<li>In a bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch and salt; set
aside
<li>In a large bowl, combine the butter, sugar and vanilla. Using an
electric mixer set on high, beat until light and fluffy.
<li>Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture and mix until
beginning to gather together into a rough dough.
<li>Mix in the walnuts
<li>Turn out the dough onto a sheet of waxed paper. Gather into a
ball, then flatten into a disk.
<li>Cover with another sheet of waxed paper. Roll out the dough &#188;
inch thick.
<li>Remove the top sheet of waxed paper and, using a heart-shaped
cookie cutter 3 inches in diameter, cut out cookies. Transfer the
cookies to an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them &#189; inch
apart. Gather up the scraps into a flat disk, reroll and cut out
additional cookies. Transfer to the baking sheet.
<li>Bake until firm to the touch and just beginning to colour, about
20 minutes.
<li>Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool
<li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks
</ol>
<p>Makes about 20</p>
<p>This festive cookie looks pretty whether left plain, sprinkled with
coloured sugar crystals, or decorated with <a href="confectionersSugarIcing.html">confectioners' sugar icing</a>
or <a href="chocolateCoating.html">chocolate coating</a>. If using the latter,
store the cookies in the refrigerator.</p>
