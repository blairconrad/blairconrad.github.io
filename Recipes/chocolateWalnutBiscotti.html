<li>Preheat an oven to 300&deg;F. Line a large baking sheet with
parchment paper or waxed paper.
<li>In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the
chocolate and sugar and grind until the chocolate is very fine. Set
aside.
<li>In a bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and
salt. Set aside.
<li>In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, combine the eggs and
vanilla. Beat at medium speed to blend.
<li>Reduce the speed to low, add the chocolate and flour mixtures and
mix until a stiff dough forms, adding the walnuts when about half
mixed
<li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and gather it
togehter. Divide in half. Form each half into a log 12 inches long.
<li>Carefully transfer the logs to the prepared baking sheet, spacing
them evenly. Pat to even up the shapes. Bake until almost firm to the
touch, about 50 minutes.
<li>Let cool for 10 minutes.
<li>Leave the oven set at 300&deg;F.
<li>Using a spatula, transfer the logs to a work surface. Using a
serrated knife, cut on the diagonal into slices &#189;-&#190; inch
thick.
<li>Return the slices cut-side down to the baking sheet. Bake for 25
minutes.
<li>Turn the slices over and bake until crisp and dry, about 25
minutes longer.
<li>Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight
container at room temperature for up to 1 month

<p>Makes about 2&#189; dozen</p>
<p>These flavourful, sophisticated, nut-studded cookies are even
better dipped in <a href="chocolateCoating.html">chocolate coating</a>.</p>
