**Make the lemonade cookie dough**

1. Beat the butter, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon extract together on medium speed until the mixture looks lighter in color than when you started, about 1 minute.
1. Add the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, beating until the batter is pale yellow, about 30 seconds.
1. Add the egg and beat until incorporated.
1. Add the flour and beat until a dough forms.
1. Scoop out the dough and transfer to a clean bowl.


**Make the iced tea cookie dough**
1. Grind the tea if it isnâ€™t finely ground enough (you can do this in a spice grinder or by placing it in a zip-top plastic bag and using a rolling pin to crush the leaves).
1. Add the egg to the tea and beat to blend.
1. Place the butter and both sugars in the bowl of the stand mixer (no need to wash it after making the lemon dough) and beat together on medium speed until the mixture looks lighter in color than when you started, about 1 minute.
1. Add the baking powder, baking soda, and salt and beat for about 30 seconds to incorporate.
1. Scrape the egg and tea into the bowl and beat for about 30 seconds more to incorporate.
1. Add both flours and beat until a dough forms.

**Finish the cookies**
1. Make a ball of lemon dough. Use a [#50 disher](http://www.bakersbrigade.com/cookie-scoop-sizes-explained/) for about 23g of dough and roll into a ball.
1. Make a same-sized ball of tea dough.
1. Combine the two balls and roll them together into one big ball.
1. Roll the ball in sugar. Smoosh it on a cookie sheet. For fun, smoosh each ball at a different angle.
1. Repeat until you fill up a cookie sheet. The cookies spread like crazy; I get 9 on a full-sized pan.
1. Bake at 350&deg;F for about 13 minutes.
1. Cool on baking sheet about 5 minutes.
1. Cool completely on a rack.
