<li>In a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the milk
chocolate and orange juice concentrate. Stir constantly until smooth.
<li>Add the butter and stir until incorporated. Pour into a bowl; this
mixture is the truffle filling.
<li>Cover and freeze until firm enough to mound in a spoon, about 40
minutes.
<li>Line a baking sheet with foil. Using a tablespoon, scoop out
rounded spoonfuls of the filling and drop onto the sheet, spacing
evenly.
<li>Cover and freeze until almost firm, but still pliable, about 30
minutes.
<li>Roll each chocolate mound between your palms into a smooth ball,
then roll in cocoa.
<li>Return balls to the sheet. Freeze while preparing the coating.
<li>Line another baking sheet with foil.
<li>Place the bittersweet or semisweet chocolate in the top pan of a
double boiler or in a heatproof bowl. Set over (but not touching) barely simmering
water. Heat, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth. Remove from
heat.
<li>Drop 1 truffle ball into the chocolate, tilting the pan if
necessary to coat the ball completely. Slip a fork under the truffle,
lift it from the chocolate and tap the fork gently against the side of
the pan to allow any excess chocolate to drip off. Using a knife,
gently slide the truffle off the fork and onto the prepared baking
sheet. Repeat with the remaining truffles.
<li>Refrigerate uncovered until firm, about 1 hour.
<li>Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3
weeks.

<p>To give an extra-special touch, dust with cocoa powder or drizzle
with melted milk chocolate</p>
