* Butter a 12-cup muffin tin, or line with paper muffin cups.
* For the filling:
    1. Beat together the cream cheese, granulated sugar, and egg until smooth.
    1. Stir in the chopped chocolate pieces.
    1. Set aside.
* For the batter:
    1. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
    1. In a separate bowl, mix together the water, oil, and vanilla.
    1. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the wet ingredients, just until smooth. Do not overmix.
* Divide the batter among the muffin cups, and spoon a few tablespoons of filling into the center of each cupcake, dividing the filling evenly. The cups will be almost completely full.
* Bake for 25 minutes at 350&deg;F (175&deg;C), or until the tops are slightly golden brown and the cupcakes feel springy when gently pressed.

<p>Makes about 12 cupcakes.</p>
