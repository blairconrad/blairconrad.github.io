<li>Butter a 15-by-10 inch jelly-roll pan. Line with waxed paper.
<li>Place the white chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler or in
a heatproof bowl set over (but not touching) barely simmering
water. Stir frequently until melted and smooth.
<li>Place the bittersweet or semisweet chocolate in the top pan of
another double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over (but not
touching) barely simmering water. Stir frequently until melted and
smooth.
<li>Stir &#190; cup of the nuts into the white chocolate.
<li> Pour the white chocolate onto the prepared jelly-roll pan to form
3 stripes the full length of the pan, one down each side and one down
the middle.
<li>Mix &#189; cup of the nuts and the coffee into the bittersweet or
semisweet chocolate.
<li>Pour this chocolate onto the pan, forming 2 stripes between the
white chocolate stripes.
<li>Draw the tip of a small knife back and forth across both
chocolates to form a marble pattern.
<li>Tilt the pan to swirl the chocolates together.
<li>Sprinkle with the remaining &#189; cup nuts.
<li>Refrigerate uncovered until firm, at least 1 hour.
<li>Gently peel the candy from the waxed paper. Holding the candy with
the waxed paper (to prevent fingerprints on the chocolate), break into
large irregular pieces. Store in an airtight container in the
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
