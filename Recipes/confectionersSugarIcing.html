<ol>
<li>Place the confectioners' sugar in a bowl.
<li>Add the 2 tablespoons milk and the lemon juice and stir until
smooth.
<li>If the mixture is too thick to pipe or spread, then thin with a
small amount of additional milk.
<li>To colour the icing, mix in the food colouring, adding it by drops
until the desired shade is achieved. Alternatively, divide the icing
among several bowls and tint each portion a different colour.
<li>To spread the icing over cookies, use a small icing spatula or a
small knife.
<li>To pipe the icing atop cookies, spoon the icing into a pastry
bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe decoratively over the cookies.
<li>To drizzle the icing over cookies, dip a fork into the icing and
wave it back and forth over the cookies.
<li>To decorate the icing-topped cookies with coloured sugar, sprinkle
on the sugar as soon as the cookies are iced.
<li>Place the cookies on a flat surface until the icing sets, about 2
hours. Store iced cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.

<p>Makes about 1 cup</p>
