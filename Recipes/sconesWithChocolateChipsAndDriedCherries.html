<li>Preheat an oven to 425&deg;F.
<li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, the &#188; c sugar,
baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
<li>Stir in the cherries and chocolate chips
<li>Using a fork, stir in enough cream to form a slightly moist
dough. Gather the dough into a ball
<li>Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead gently
until smooth, about 15 turns. Add more cream if necessary to moisten
the dough.
<li>Roll out the dough &#190; inch thick.
<li>Using a floured biscuit cutter or glass 2&#189; inches in
diameter, cut out rounds. Transfer the rounds to an ungreased baking
sheet. Gather together the scraps, pat out &#190; thick and cut out
additional scones. Add to the baking sheet
<li>Brush the scones with melted butter.
<li>Sprinkle with sugar. 
<li>Bake until light brown and just firm to the touch, about 20
minutes.
<li>Serve warm, or let cool on racks and serve at room temperature.
<li>To store, wrap tightly in aluminum foil and keep at room
temperature for up to 1 day
