<p>Earlier this week at the day job I ran into an interesting problem
working with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable(v=vs.100).aspx">DataTable</a>.  A view that's supposed to show
a subset of the table's rows showed nothing. I dropped into the
debugger and became even more confused.</p>
<p>Visually inspecting the DataTable showed that there was a row that
matched the filter the view was using, but running <code>Select</code> still
returned nothing. I didn't bring work's code home, but here's some
code that reproduces the problem:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">Console.Out.WriteLine("0th book's Library:\t{0}", books[0].Library);
Console.Out.WriteLine("# WPL books by Select:\t{0}", library.Books.Select("Library = 'WPL'").Length);
Console.Out.WriteLine("# WPL books by LINQ:\t{0}", library.Books.Count(book => book.Library == "WPL"));</code></pre>

<p>And the output:</p>
<pre>0th book's Library:     WPL
# WPL books by Select:  0
# WPL books by LINQ:    1</pre>

<p>So, the table contains at least one book from <a href="http://www.wpl.ca">WPL</a>, <code>Select</code>ing
for that library doesn't find the book, yet iterating over all the
rows and <code>Count</code>ing them does find it.</p>
<p>Just in case you think there's some whitespace trickery going on or
something, debug with me:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blairconrad.com/images/2015-10-05-select-may-not-be-broken/debugging.png">
</figure>

<p>How is this happening? The row's Library property is actually
<code>DBNull</code>, but the dataset defines both <code>DefaultValue</code> and <code>NullValue</code>:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blairconrad.com/images/2015-10-05-select-may-not-be-broken/library_properties.png">
</figure>

<p>So even though there was <code>DBNull</code> in the row, whenever I examined the
<code>Library</code> property, via code (such as the LINQ statements) or
visually in the debugger, it appeared to be "WPL".</p>
<p><code>Select</code>, however, wasn't fooled. It knew the value was <code>DBNull</code> and
wouldn't match.</p>
<p>I'm of two minds about this. It's arguably <em>correct</em> behaviour, as the
stored value is not "WPL", but I'm not sure that it's desirable to be
able to configure the table to present data in a way that's not
supported by the query.</p>
